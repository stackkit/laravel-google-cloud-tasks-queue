# Introduction

This package allows Google Cloud Tasks to be used as the queue driver.

<details>
  <summary>
    Requirements
  </summary>

  <br>
  This package requires Laravel 10 or higher and supports MySQL 8 and PostgreSQL 15. Might support older database versions too, but package hasn't been tested for it.

Please check the [Laravel support policy](https://laravel.com/docs/master/releases#support-policy) table for supported Laravel and PHP versions.

  <summary>Installation</summary>
  <br>

  Require the package using Composer

  ```console
  composer require stackkit/laravel-google-cloud-tasks-queue
  ```

  Add a new queue connection to `config/queue.php`

  ```php
  'cloudtasks' => [
      'driver' => 'cloudtasks',
      'project' => env('STACKKIT_CLOUD_TASKS_PROJECT', ''),
      'location' => env('STACKKIT_CLOUD_TASKS_LOCATION', ''),
      'handler' => env('STACKKIT_CLOUD_TASKS_HANDLER', ''),
      'queue' => env('STACKKIT_CLOUD_TASKS_QUEUE', 'default'),
      'service_account_email' => env('STACKKIT_CLOUD_TASKS_SERVICE_EMAIL', ''),
      'signed_audience' => env('STACKKIT_CLOUD_TASKS_SIGNED_AUDIENCE', true),
      // Optional: The deadline in seconds for requests sent to the worker. If the worker
      // does not respond by this deadline then the request is cancelled and the attempt
      // is marked as a DEADLINE_EXCEEDED failure.
      'dispatch_deadline' => null,
      'backoff' => 0,
  ],
  ```

Update the `QUEUE_CONNECTION` environment variable

  ```dotenv
  QUEUE_CONNECTION=cloudtasks
  ```

Now that the package is installed, the final step is to set the correct environment variables.

Please check the table below on what the values mean and what their value should be.

| Environment variable                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |Example
--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---
| `STACKKIT_CLOUD_TASKS_PROJECT`       | The project your queue belongs to.                                                                                                                                                        |`my-project`
| `STACKKIT_CLOUD_TASKS_LOCATION`      | The region where the project is hosted                                                                                                                                                    |`europe-west6`
| `STACKKIT_CLOUD_TASKS_QUEUE`         | The default queue a job will be added to                                                                                                                                                  |`emails`
| `STACKKIT_CLOUD_TASKS_SERVICE_EMAIL` | The email address of the service account. Important, it should have the correct roles. See the section below which roles.                                                        |`my-service-account@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`
| `STACKKIT_CLOUD_TASKS_HANDLER` (optional) | The URL that Cloud Tasks will call to process a job. This should be the URL to your Laravel app. By default we will use the URL that dispatched the job. |`https://<your website>.com`
| `STACKKIT_CLOUD_TASKS_SIGNED_AUDIENCE` (optional) | True or false depending if you want extra security by signing the audience of your tasks. May misbehave in certain Cloud Run setups. Defaults to true.   | `true`

  How it works & Differences
</summary>
  <br>
  Using Cloud Tasks as a Laravel queue driver is fundamentally different than other Laravel queue drivers, like Redis.

Typically a Laravel queue has a worker that listens to incoming jobs using the `queue:work` / `queue:listen` command.
With Cloud Tasks, this is not the case. Instead, Cloud Tasks will schedule the job for you and make an HTTP request to your application with the job payload. There is no need to run a `queue:work/listen` command.

#### Good to know

- The "Min backoff" and "Max backoff" options in Cloud Tasks are ignored. This is intentional: Laravel has its own backoff feature (which is more powerful than what Cloud Tasks offers) and therefore I have chosen that over the Cloud Tasks one.
- Similarly to the backoff feature, I have also chosen to let the package do job retries the 'Laravel way'. In Cloud Tasks, when a task throws an exception, Cloud Tasks will decide for itself when to retry the task (based on the backoff values). It will also manage its own state and knows how many times a task has been retried. This is different from Laravel. In typical Laravel queues, when a job throws an exception, the job is deleted and released back onto the queue. In order to support Laravel's backoff feature, this package must behave the same way about job retries.

  <summary>Dashboard (beta)</summary>
  <br>
  The package comes with a beautiful dashboard that can be used to monitor all queued jobs.

_Experimental_

The dashboard works by storing all outgoing tasks in a database table. When Cloud Tasks calls the application and this
package handles the task, we will automatically update the tasks' status, attempts
and possible errors.

There is probably a (small) performance penalty because each task dispatch and handling does extra database read and writes.
Also, the dashboard has not been tested with high throughput queues.

To make use of it, enable it through the `.env` file:

  ```dotenv
  STACKKIT_CLOUD_TASKS_DASHBOARD_ENABLED=true
  STACKKIT_CLOUD_TASKS_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=MySecretLoginPasswordPleaseChangeThis
  ```

Then publish its assets and migrations:

  ```console
  php artisan vendor:publish --tag=cloud-tasks
  php artisan migrate
  ```

The dashboard is accessible at the URI: /cloud-tasks

  <summary>Authentication</summary>
  <br>

Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable with a path to the credentials file.

More info: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production

If you're not using your master service account (which has all abilities), you must add the following roles to make it works:
1. App Engine Viewer
2. Cloud Tasks Enqueuer
3. Cloud Tasks Viewer
4. Cloud Tasks Task Deleter
5. Service Account User
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Security</summary>
  <br>
  The job handler requires each request to have an OpenID token. In the installation step we set the service account email, and with that service account, Cloud Tasks will generate an OpenID token and send it along with the job payload to the handler.

This package verifies that the token is digitally signed by Google. Only Google Tasks will be able to call your handler.
